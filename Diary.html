                                <h3 class="heading"><a href="#"></a>The Beginning of Time</h3>
                                <p style="text-align:justify;">It all started in our 1st Standard. We were too young to understand what love actually is. 
                                    I understood love as a feeling where one person is willing to do anything for the other. The most pure form of love. 
                                    I still remember that there was only 1 day in the entire year when I sat beside you. That was the best day of my school life till then. 
                                    I know it was not much of a school life, we just started but I felt very happy that I sat beside you. 
                                    Noone will believe it but that was like a dream come true. As I can recall it was some exam and we had our art files as partition 
                                    in between so that we don't cheat. Then also I was too shy to talk to her.

                                <p style="text-align:justify;">I was surprised and happy to see her in my class for one more year. 
                                    I was still a child and found her attractive a lot.
                                </p>

                                <h3 class="heading"><a href="#"></a>The Recall</h3>
                                <p style="text-align:justify;">I don't recall much of this time apart from some flashes, but whenever I think about that time I get 
                                    a smile on my face. She was in my class I used to see her everyday in class. If I had a bad day and I get a glimpse of her in class, 
                                    I felt calm and gained energy to survice the day. From this time I felt more attached to her as we were all growing up and knowing 
                                    what all these emotions were. But I was still very shy to talk to her directly.

                                <p style="text-align:justify;">When we were in 12th standard, I remember that you and Anmol started going home together and 
                                    I and Rohan started going home together. There was a day when you had an accident just after school and I came to know in 
                                    the evening. I was stressed about you for the whole time and scared how you were as I had not seen the extent of the accident 
                                    and I was having nightmares if you were okay. At that time also I had strong feelings for you but I knew that you can never 
                                    say yes to a person like me, an immature and kiddish guy who was not even serious about his life. Who was madly in love with 
                                    a girl and ready to do anything for her happiness. If she was having a bad day then he was willing to do anything to bring just 
                                    one smile on her face.
                                </p>

                                <p style="text-align:justify;">Alas the time was here when we had to part ways for college and undergraduate courses. 
                                    Little did I know that this won't just be a bump in my life but a majour diversion. I saw less of you. 
                                    We talked very less, drifted apart. I started having thoughts about you as how you might be, where were you. 
                                    I can recall on our farewell, I had to muster a lot of courage to ask you for a pic together. I won't have been 
                                    able to do it if Anmol and Deeksha had not told me to ask you. You were looking so good in saree and I was not 
                                    able to pull my eyes away from you. When you were not near me I started searching for you, Just one glimpse is 
                                    what I wanted to keep me going.

                                <p style="text-align:justify;">All my prayers were heard when Anmol asked me to come to her birthday party on 
                                    time when we were in undergraduate studies. The only motive for me to go was a chance to see you, and the 
                                    moment I saw you there I felt a relief which I cannot explain. I don't have words for that. Listening to 
                                    your voice after so long, seeing you in flesh and blood after all those years was more to me than anything 
                                    in my life. We were drinking but that intoxication was nothing as compared to meeting you after all those 
                                    years. But I had a fear lurking in my mind. I was scared that this was just a temporary thing and tomorrow 
                                    again I will be at some other place and you will be at some other place.

                                <p style="text-align:justify;">Late but better that it occurred.... 
                                    The childhood urge of falling for Ramita hit me again today... 
                                    Spending one day with her doesn't seems like enough... I crave for her presence, her company, her touch and her voice. 
                                    It hit me late that whatever I have always wanted, maybe I had it all along... I just didn't have the courage and confidence to face
                                    it... To say it.... To say "Ramita !!! I Love you"
                                    There is a 70% probability that it will result in negative, she will say No she doesn't have any feelings towards me...
                                    Today (28/01/2023) even after drinking so much I didn't have the courage to ask if she can have feelings for me... I
                                    know it is bad and cowardly to ask things when you are drunk but here I am writing this while drunk and just pouring my
                                    heart out on a Google keep note... Hoping that this will find her some day and make her realise that the things I have
                                    said for her and my feelings towards her are true and not just random Flirting.... The things I have said to her about
                                    caring for her and keeping her above everything else are true.... The day she feels and seaess..... To ask a direct
                                    question when the person is not drunk and sober takes more courage than a drunk person.

                                    know under what life or death circumstances I sent you these thoughts, I don't know
                                    how I mustered this courage. I just want you to know that I Still Love You, always
                                    had and always will, no matter whatever happens. Even if you think that I am not 
                                    serious about you or I am just flirting and saying random dialogues to sound cool.
                                    My love for you is pure and not bound to anything. You are the first love of my life 
                                    whom I wanted with me for the rest of my life. You give me Hope and Courage to face 
                                    anything.
