The Meeting

1st class
It all started in our 1st Standard. We were too young to understand what love actually is. I understood love as a feeling where
one person is willing to do anything for the other. The most pure form of love. I still remember that there was only 1 day in the entire year
when I sat beside you. That was the best day of my school life till then. I know it was not much of a school life, we just started but I felt
very happy that I sat beside you. Noone will believe it but that was like a dream come true. As I can recall it was some exam and we had our 
art files as partition in between so that we don't cheat. Then also I was too shy to talk to her. 

2nd class
I was surprised and happy to see her in my class for one more year. I was still a child and found her attractive a lot.

6th class
I don't recall much of this time apart from some flashes, but whenever I think about that time I get a smile on my face. She was in my class
I used to see her everyday in class. If I had a bad day and I get a glimpse of her in class, I felt calm and gained energy to survice the day.
From this time I felt more attached to her as we were all growing up and knowing what all these emotions were. But I was still very shy to talk 
to her directly. 

12th class
When we were in 12th standard, I remember that you and Anmol started going home together and I and Rohan started going home together. There was a 
day when you had an accident just after school and I came to know in the evening. I was stressed about you for the whole time and scared how 
you were as I had not seen the extent of the accident and I was having nightmares if you were okay. At that time also I had strong feelings for you
but I knew that you can never say yes to a person like me, an immature and kiddish guy who was not even serious about his life. Who was madly in love 
with a girl and ready to do anything for her happiness. If she was having a bad day then he was willing to do anything to bring just one smile on her 
face. 

Farewell
Alas the time was here when we had to part ways for college and undergraduate courses. Little did I know that this won't just be a bump in my life
but a majour diversion. I saw less of you. We talked very less, drifted apart. I started having thoughts about you as how you might be, where were you.
I can recall on our farewell, I had to muster a lot of courage to ask you for a pic together. I won't have been able to do it if Anmol and Deeksha had
not told me to ask you. You were looking so good in saree and I was not able to pull my eyes away from you. When you were not near me I started searching
for you, Just one glimpse is what I wanted to keep me going.

The Timeline
The good old college days, the best days that a guy can have, The Golden College days. Well I can say this but I felt something missing in my life, I felt 
incomplete without you there. I wished everyday that you were in the same college and we had more time to spend together. I thought about you everyday, It's
not that I was alone there or I didn't have anyone. I missed you a lot Ramita. I still do. Whenever you posted a new photo or a video I felt so good, seeing 
you there, smiling, looking so damn gorgeous. 

Anmol Birthday During College
All my prayers were heard when Anmol asked me to come to her birthday party on time when we were in undergraduate studies. The only motive for me to go was
a chance to see you, and the moment I saw you there I felt a relief which I cannot explain. I don't have words for that. Listening to your voice after so
long, seeing you in flesh and blood after all those years was more to me than anything in my life. We were drinking but that intoxication was nothing as 
compared to meeting you after all those years. But I had a fear lurking in my mind. I was scared that this was just a temporary thing and tomorrow again I
will be at some other place and you will be at some other place.
